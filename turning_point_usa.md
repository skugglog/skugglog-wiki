## Summary
Turning Point USA is a conservative youth organization that promotes right-wing politics on high school and college campuses. Founded in 2012 by Charlie Kirk, it has grown into a national network with chapters in multiple states. While TPUSA presents itself as a mainstream conservative group, watchdog organizations have criticized it for repeatedly platforming extremist-aligned speakers and for spreading disinformation.

## History & Activity
Turning Point USA was established with the goal of organizing conservative students against what it claims is liberal dominance in academia. The group runs national conferences, leadership summits, and maintains a large online presence. Critics, including civil rights organizations, have noted TPUSAâ€™s associations with individuals espousing white nationalist or extremist rhetoric.  
TPUSA maintains significant influence within Republican politics, and its founder Charlie Kirk is a frequent media commentator.
